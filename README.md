## LHAPDF

> LHAPDF is the standard tool for evaluating parton distribution functions (PDFs) in high-energy physics. 
> https://www.lhapdf.org/index.html

>  It is both a framework for uniform access to the results of many different PDF fitting groups and a collection of such PDF sets.

## Notation:

$B$ represents the hadron involved.

Important reminders:

1. `.xfxQ()` returns a value of $x f_{i/B} \left(x; Q \right)$

2. `.xfxQ2()` returns a value of $x f_{i/B} \left(x; Q^{2} \right)$
